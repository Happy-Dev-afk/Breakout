My second project in the 20 Game Challenge.

A basic Breakout clone made in Unity. I struggled a lot with fixing the bounce angle when the ball got stuck, learned a ton about Rigidbody2D, velocity, and floating point issues.

This was the game that made me realize: writing code teaches way more than just reading or watching tutorials.
